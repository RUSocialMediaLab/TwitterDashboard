# LA dashboard project - generic 
=======

As social media take root in our society, more and more University instructors are incorporating platforms like Twitter into their classroom. However, very few of the current Learning Analytics (LA) systems and dashboards are able to process and visualize social media data for the purpose of instructional interventions and evaluation. 

As a result, instructors who are using social media in the classroom have no easy way to assess their students learning progress or to use the data to adjust and improve their lessons in real time. 

The dashboard analyzes tweets produced under a specific course hashtag, and displays the resulting visualizations for an instructor to use for their own exploration. The goal is to allow instructors to see the ways in which students engage with each other using Twitter.
